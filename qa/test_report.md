# QA Test Report - Todo List App

## Summary
The application was tested against the requirements outlined in Task 1 (wireframe) and Task 2 (functionality). The application is fully functional and meets the core requirements. A few minor discrepancies were found between the wireframe and the implementation, but they do not affect the application's functionality.

## Findings

### Functionality
- **Adding Tasks:** Works as expected. New tasks are added to the list.
- **Deleting Tasks:** Works as expected. Tasks are removed from the list.
- **Toggling Task Completion:** Works as expected. The completed status of tasks can be toggled.

### Discrepancies
The following minor discrepancies from the wireframe were noted:
1.  **Header Text:** The header text is `Todo List` instead of the specified `Todo List App`.
2.  **Add Button Text:** The add button text is `Add Task` instead of `Add`.
3.  **Delete Button:** The delete button is a `🗑️` icon instead of an `X`.

## Conclusion
The application passes the quality assurance test. The noted discrepancies are minor and do not impact functionality. It is recommended to align the UI with the wireframe for consistency, but it is not a blocking issue.
